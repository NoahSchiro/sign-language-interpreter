# sign-language-interpreter
---

Currently this repo is functioning as a way for me to learn more about CV, but eventually this will be an application which is able to take an image from the webcam and display it. It will find a hand in the image and then use machine learning to determine what kind sign language letter the hand is making. It will then add this letter to a string and print it on top of the image
